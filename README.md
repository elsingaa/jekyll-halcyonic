When browsing the internet for a usable theme for our family website I came across Halcyonic by HTML5 UP.
Since our website is built with the static site generator Jekyll I had to convert it to Jekyll, which I think went rather well.

The author, suprisingly also by the name AJ, said about the template:

A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
